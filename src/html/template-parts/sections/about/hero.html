					I have  5+ years of experience in video editing, mostly in the social media & YouTube space. My edits has generated over 25M+ views to my clients. I have a good understanding of making platform optimized videos, knowledge of metrics & most important making a video that doesnâ€™t bore the viewer. with my experience and skills, I was able to work with some big creators like Xiaomanyc (6m), Rising Women (2m IG), Shade Zahrai (1m+)... I was able to achieve some impressive results for my clients like with Ben (100k followers), a coach, hitting his first 1M+ views on Instagram reel simply by repurposing his podcasts. There are many more things. But I always do my best to deliver the absolute best for my clients
